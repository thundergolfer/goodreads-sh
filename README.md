> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** This is only my 2nd Rust project, after [`slackify-markdown`](https://github.com/thundergolfer/slackify-markdown), and so while the project is functional the code is _not_ pretty.

## Installation

#### Homebrew

`coming soon` 

#### Manual Installtion

`coming soon`

#### [Required] Developer key
`goodreadsh` requires your developer key and developer secret in order to read-write to the goodreads API. Obtaining them is fairly trivial.

1. Access your developer key and secret [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys).
2. Copy your developer key and secret over to `goodreads-sh`'s config file. `~/.goodreads.toml`
```sh
developer_key = "<your_key_here>"
developer_secret = "<your_secret_here>"
```

Your config file should already be present in your home dir `~/.goodreads.toml` and if it's not, then run the command once without any options or create the file manually.

## Usage

`coming soon`

## Credit

- Kudos to [Danish Prakash](https://github.com/danishprakash/) for his implementation, [`goodreadsh`](https://github.com/danishprakash/goodreadsh), which I used and learned from while I developed this CLI. üôè
