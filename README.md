## Installation

#### Homebrew

`coming soon` 

#### Manual Installtion

`coming soon`

#### [Required] Developer key
`goodreadsh` requires your developer key in order to use the goodreads API, obtaining one is fairly trivial.

1. Access your developer key [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys).
2. Copy your developer key over to `goodreadsh`'s config file. `~/.goodreads.conf`
```sh
DEVELOPER_KEY="<your_key_here>"
```

Your config file should already be present in your home dir `~/.goodreads.conf` and if it's not, then run the command once without any options or create the file manually.

## Usage

`coming soon`
